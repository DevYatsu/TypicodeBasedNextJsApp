This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Everything is still to do

I intend to work on the project asap guys. Don't worry if there is almost nothing for now, I am going to implement an oauth working with the typicode [/users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) as well as a profile page to see your profile once connected. Also I am going to add an albums page and a way to see comments on click on the already readable posts. Maybe it would be nice to also implement a way to add posts once connected to one of the users!
